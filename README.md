# OIT-Robosub
Oregon Tech Robosub (AUVSI) Software Team

	Introduction
Everything will be done mainly in Python for vision processing and machine learning. Hardware control for the sub will be accomplished primarily using Atmel Studio using C code on an ATMEGA328p microcontroller. Basic goals for software is object tracking with cameras, and for embedded is controlling the thrusters with a flight controller.

The following is a list of websites to get started on researching Machine Learning (ML) to use in our design for the sub.

	Long Term Goals
Eventually, using an FPGA to either replace/complement the Microcontroller on the Sub Arduino would provide some unique implications in terms of computational speed and hardware control. If an FPGA were to be integrated, likely an Intel FPGA, or Xilinx Board, SystemVerilog would be the optimal choice for HDL usage.
